# Part 005 â€“ Azure CLI Basics (day-6)

## Goal

Understand what Azure CLI is, where it is used, and why it matters in real cloud environments.

## What is Azure CLI?

Azure CLI is a command-line tool for managing Azure resources quickly and efficiently.  
It allows automation, consistency, and advanced scripting, reducing dependency on manual portal clicks.

---

## Scenario

You were asked to provision a VM using Azure CLI instead of the Portal.  
Although you are not expected to run the commands yet, you're exploring the structure and power of CLI tools.

---

## CLI Environment Accessed

You have successfully opened the Azure Cloud Shell from the Portal.  
CLI access is now available directly from your browser.
