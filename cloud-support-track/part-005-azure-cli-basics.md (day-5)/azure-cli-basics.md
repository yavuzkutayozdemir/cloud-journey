### Part 005 — Azure cli basics (day 5)

this part explores how to manage azure resources through the azure cloud shell, without touching the local terminal.

### Scenario

i needed to provision a virtual machine and manage it using cli tools instead of the portal.  
i accessed the cloud shell directly from the azure portal and reviewed the cli environment.

---

### Goal

access and review the azure cli environment via browser-based cloud shell.  
understand how command-line tools enable faster and automated operations.

- launched cloud shell (bash) from the top menu  
- verified the azure cli environment was active  
- explored basic az command syntax

### Problem faced

i couldn’t access the azure cli from my local machine due to lack of setup and permissions.  
this made it difficult to test or manage resources using command-line tools.

---

### How i solved it

i used the azure portal’s built-in cloud shell to run azure cli commands directly in the browser.  
this allowed me to bypass local setup entirely and still perform cli-based management tasks.

---

### Outcome

- gained hands-on experience with azure cli  
- understood how cloud shell can replace local cli setup  
- successfully explored command structure and usage
